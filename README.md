# Nick_Learns_C# 

This is a repository for my C# learning.

I'll be working through a few courses on CodeAcademy.com to learn how to build with an entirely different language to what I've learned in the past.

In combination with the ASP.NET course I'm also studying - I'll be building my own project to work with the ASP.NET framework and hoping to host it with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Enjoy!
