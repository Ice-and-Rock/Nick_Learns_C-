- How to use comparison operators with different data types to return boolean values
- What a truth table is and how to read one
- How to use logical operators to compare boolean values and expressions

- Checks a password if it has uppercase letters and doesnâ€™t include symbols
- Tells you if you should watch a TV show if it has your favorite actor or is your favorite drama
