# LOOPS

## Review

Well done! In C#, loops are commonly used because they save time, reduce errors, and are easy to read. Being comfortable with each type of loop will make you a better programmer. In review:

A loop is a structure in programming where the instructions are written once, but a computer can execute them multiple times
Each execution of those instructions is called an iteration
while loops repeat until a condition changes
do...while loops execute once, and then repeat until a condition changes
for loops repeat for a specified number of times
foreach loops repeat for each item in a collection
jump statements, like break, continue, and return are used to add additional control flow to loops
Now that you know a few things about loops, try writing a program that:

Loops through a piece of text and only prints words that start with the letter “a” to the console to create a poem.
Loops through a list of numbers and if it is even, print even and if it’s odd, print odd.
A Choose Your Own Adventure game that uses a while loop to make sure a user chooses a correct option.
