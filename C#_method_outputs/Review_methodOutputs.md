# METHOD OUTPUT

## Review

Congrats on finishing! You can now use and define methods with output.

Here’s what else you’ve learned in this lesson:

- Methods return values with the return keyword.
- Every method has a return type, designated in its method signature. That type must match the type of the value actually returned.
- If a method returns no type, its return type is void.
out parameters can be used to return multiple values from a method.
- You can always review this material on the Microsoft documentation.
